# 31 EDO Retuner plugin for Musescore 2

Musescore plugin to automatically retune notes in [31-EDO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/31_equal_temperament)

## Usage

- To retune the entire score as is, simply run the plugin and click "Retune!"

- If a selection was made prior to clicking "Retune!", only the selected
notes will be affected.

### Accidentals

#### Ups and Downs notation (diatonic enharmonic equivalent)

In ups and downs notation mode, these are the accidentals used by the
plugin. They can be found in the [advanced palette](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/palettes-and-workspaces#workspaces).

| Diesis steps | Accidental |
| ---: | :-----:|
| -5  | ![Double flat](images/bb.png) |
| -4  | ![Sesqui flat](images/db.png)  |
| -3  | ![Flat down](images/bd.png)  |
| -2  | ![Flat](images/b.png)  |
| -1  | ![Down](images/d.png) or ![Flat up](images/bu.png) |
| 0   | ![Natural](images/n.png) |
| +1  | ![Up](images/u.png) or ![Sharp down](images/sd.png) |
| +2  | ![Sharp](images/s.png)  |
| +3  | ![Sharp up](images/su.png) |
| +4  | ![Sesqui sharp](images/ss.png)  |
| +5  | ![Double sharp](images/x.png)  |

> Important: This notation differs from the more conventional meantone notation
> which uses quarter-tone accidentals instead. Meantone notation support is still a WIP.
>
> The benefits of using this notation over meantone is that it allows for proper
> spelling of notes and chords in all transpositions as it still supports enharmonic diatonic-tone equivalents
> by means of the double flat and double sharp accidentals.

#### Meantone (quarter-tone accidentals)

**WIP**

### Custom key signatures

As MuseScore doesn't completely support
[custom key signatures](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/key-signatures#custom-key-signatures),
any custom key signature can't be read by the plugin, at least for now.

Should you want to create a microtonal key signature and have it affect the
playback, you have to explicitly declare the custom key signature using some
*super-special accidental code*:

#### Accidental Code

| Diesis steps | *Super-special accidental code* |
| ----: | :----: |
| -5   | `bb` |
| -4   | `db`  |
| -3   | `bv`  |
| -2   | `b`  |
| -1   | `b^` or `v`|
| 0  | Leave blank  |
| 1   | `^` or `#v` |
| 2  | `#`  |
| 3   | `#^`  |
| 4  | `#+`  |
| 5   |  `x` |


There are two ways you can enter the accidental code as shown below.

> Note that explicit accidentals will still take precedence over the
> declared custom key signature, behaving exactly the same way a key signature
> would.

#### Method 1: Using the text input fields in the plugin window (Obsoleted)

![Text field custom key sig](images/2018/06/text-field-custom-key-sig.png)

This method will only allow tuning to one custom key signature at a time,
if there are changes in key signature that modulate from or to a custom key
signature, each section will have to be tuned independently by selecting
the section to retune before clicking "Retune".

If there are numerous key signature changes, or require local key signatures
(hooray for simultaneous microtonality and polytonality!), use Method 2 instead...

#### Method 2: Using staff text

![Staff text custom key sig](images/2018/06/staff-text-custom-key-sig.png)

This method allows you to indicate custom key signatures in the score itself
by entering *super-special key signature code* inside
System Text or Staff Text.

- Use **System Text** (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `T`) if you want the super-special key signature code to affect
  all staves from there onwards
- Use **Staff Text** (`Shift` + `T`) if you only want the code to affect the staff that it is on.
  This is especially useful when using custom **local** time signatures!

The syntax of this *super-special key signature code* is simple:

1. Start with a dot `.`
2. Put the required accidental for the note **C** using the [accidental code](#accidental-code)
3. Put another dot `.`
4. Put the required accidental for **D**
5. Repeat from **C** thru **B**

Note that There **must** be seven `.` in total,
natural accidentals are denoted by leaving the space blank,
and spaces/newlines can be placed before or after the dots to improve readability.

**For example:**
Ab-down major can be denoted like this: `.v.bv.bv.v.v.bv.bv`
representing the key signature of Cv, Dbv, Ebv, Fv, Gv, Abv, Bbv.

**IMPORTANT!** Following a custom key signature, should there be a modulation to any standard
key signature, it is still necessary to reset the custom key signature to the default, that is,
`.......`. Otherwise, the previous custom key signature would still be in effect, as it is being
overriden.


### Note to self / developers:

##### Definitions:

`tpc`
: Tonal pitch class

`segment.annotations[idx].textStyleType`
: 22 if Staff Text,
: 21 if System Text

`segment.annotations[idx].text`
: Contains given text

## TODO:

- Don't hard-code / bruteforce frequencies, just use a dictionary a exponential operations instead
- Hence, supporting other EDOs should be easier.

## Changes:

### 1.2

- Fixed non-naturalised explicit natural accidental in note affected by a custom key signature
- Added support for declaring custom key signature changes in SystemText/StaffText
- Added usage guide in this file
- Preparing for meantone quartertone-accidental mode support

### 1.1

- Fixed occassional bug where microtonal accidentals carry over the bar line when it shouldn't
- Attempted to fix UI bug in Windows, haven't tested it yet though :/
