# 31-ET EDO Retuner plugin for Musescore 2

Musescore plugin to automatically retune notes in 31-TEDO

### Note to self / developers:

##### Definitions:

`tpc`
: Tonal pitch class

## TODO:

- Don't hard-code / bruteforce frequencies, just use a dictionary a exponential operations instead
- Hence, supporting other EDOs should be easier.

## Changes:

### 1.1

- Fixed occassional bug where microtonal accidentals carry over the bar line when it shouldn't
- Attempted to fix UI bug in Windows, haven't tested it yet though :/
